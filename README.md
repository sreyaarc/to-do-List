# to-do-List
- A fully-functional to-do list created using node.js, express.js, ejs templating, mongoose.
- It uses MongoDB Atlas as cloud database.
- Instead of the traditional to-do lists using html, css and js, it is built using backend technologies!!! 

- Users can create their own custom task managers. If you want to create a task manager to keep a track of all your work related projects, then simply go to website link and append "/yourCustomTaskManagerName", in this case "the base url.../work" or "the base url.../gym" and so on and then you will be redirected to the custom route and you can manage your tasks there.
